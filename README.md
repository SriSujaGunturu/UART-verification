This project verifies a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) design using the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). It includes test scenarios for full-duplex, half-duplex, loopback, parity error, framing error, overrun, and timeout conditions, with integrated scoreboard and coverage analysis.
